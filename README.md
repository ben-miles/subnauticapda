# subnauticapda
 A second screen companion app for the game Subnautica.
 Built with VueJS for reactivity, and an emphasis on visual theming to maintain immersion.

 Made to ease the crafting process by turning your phone or tablet into an always-on, expanded version of the in-game "PDA," eliminating the need to memorize (or frequently stop and check) crafting recipes for needed items.

 Click items in the "Items" tab to add the crafting recipe to the "List" tab. Click items in the "List" tab to remove them. The "Notes" tab allows for miscellaneous reminders. All user data is kept in `localStorage`, and will be there when you come back, even after closing your browser tab/window.
